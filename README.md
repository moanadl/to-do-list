# THE PROJECT

A while ago my family and I needed to organize and assign some tasks between us and I decided to take this as an opportunity to create a little project using some tools I wasn't so familiar with yet. Those were the tools:

- First, for the overall design I have asked chatGPT for a little help to speed up the proccess.
- Then, I've used drag-and-drop events to move the entered tasks.
- Finally, and knowing that the focus of this project wasn't backend or database, I've found a simple solution to save the tasks board. This solution was the use of localStorage. Considering that this site was only gonna be used by me, on my machine, this alternative seemed adequated althought it isn't very recommended.
